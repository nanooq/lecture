# OHAI! 

this is a template for lectures, making use of latex, beamer, and
pgf/tikz. It produces lecture notes and lecture slides in roughly one
go.[1] It makes use of make, bash, and (of course) latex to achieve
this.

## How to Start 

We have prepared a neat (yet unfinished) installation script. It is
found in bin/initLecture.sh. It copies the necessary files, creates
links to our files and may even initiate titles, dates and such.
Furtermore you get some templates thrown in for free.


## License 
The License is the MIT License, until further notice.


## Open Topics

* Produce PDF-files, that are named differently, based on the lectures
  name. (Students' request, they get confused, if all lecture materials
  have the same file name. Understandable, if you ask me.)
* make makedepend recursive
* ...

[1] Given you know honed your LaTeÏ‡ skill in the past, it should be not
to difficult to get started.
